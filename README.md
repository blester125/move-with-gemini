# move-with-gemini

Script that I used to have gemini convert my handwritten list of what is packed in boxes into a digital form.

Download the script with
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blester125/move-with-gemini/refs/heads/main/moving_list.py
```

Run the script with
```sh
GEMINI_API_KEY=${YOUR_KEY} ./moving_list.py --image /path/to/your/image.jpg
```
